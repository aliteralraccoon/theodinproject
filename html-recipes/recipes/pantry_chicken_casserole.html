    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Using pantry items plus a couple of fresh items, you can create a cheesy, comforting casserole your whole family will love. Though it does include RO*TEL® and a can of mild green chile peppers, it's not spicy, but if you like the heat, choose hot RO*TEL® and peppers.</p>
    <p>This pantry chicken casserole reheats well, too, but I had to hide it, or there would have been no night #2! A crusty bread and a green salad complete this easy pantry meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (16oz) package penne pasta</li>
        <li>4 tbsp salted butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper - stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 (8oz) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 (8oz) packages processed cheese food (such as Velveeta), cubed</li>
        <li>1 (14.5oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>1 (10oz) can diced tomatoes and green chilies (such as RO*TEL), undrained</li>
        <li>1 (4oz) can mild chopped green chile peppers</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a large casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until they release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in processed cheese food, diced tomatoes, and juice, diced tomatoes and green chiles with juice, and mild chile peppers. Cook and stir until cheese has melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cooked pasta and chicken. Pour into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
